        <h2> RICK ASTLEY </h2>
        <p id = "Rick_astley"> 
            Richard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer, songwriter, radio DJ and podcaster.[1] He gained fame through his association with the production trio Stock Aitken Waterman, releasing the 1987 album Whenever You Need Somebody, which sold 15 million copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by both the BPI and the RIAA. His debut single "Never Gonna Give You Up" was a No. 1 hit in more than 25 countries, winning the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single. <br> 

            In 1988, Astley followed up his debut album with Hold Me in Your Arms which achieved Platinum and Gold certifications internationally. The lead single "She Wants to Dance with Me" became a worldwide Top 10 hit. In 1991, he left Stock Aitken Waterman and moved his musical direction towards soul, which he explored on his other albums. His 1991 single "Cry for Help" was his last single to reach the Top 10 in either the US or UK. In 1993, he retired from music to focus on spending time with his partner and daughter. He returned to the music industry in 2000 and released 50 to celebrate his 50th birthday in 2016, with the album debuting in the UK at No. 1.[4] His most recent studio album Are We There Yet? was released in 2023. <br> 

           In an interview ahead of the publication of his autobiography, Astley said "I think it did form me as a person, definitely, and formed a lot of my choices of why I went into music and why I wanted to be on a stage and why I wanted people's attention because I don't think I got enough attention from my parents." <br> 
            
           [3][17] After leaving school at 16, Astley was employed during the day as a driver in his father's market-gardening business and played drums on the Northern club circuit at night in bands such as Give Way specialising in covering Beatles and Shadows songs and FBI, which won several local talent competitions. <br>

        <h2> NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP - Rick Astley's most popular song </h2>
        <p> "Never Gonna Give You Up" is a pop song by English singer Rick Astley, released on 27 July 1987. The song is widely regarded as Astley's most popular, as well as his signature song, and it is often played at the end of his live concerts. Written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, it was released by RCA Records as the first single from Astley's debut studio album, Whenever You Need Somebody (1987), with a music video directed by Simon West. <br>

        The song became a worldwide hit, initially in the United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed at the top of the chart for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. It eventually topped charts in 25 different countries, including the US and West Germany,[7] and winning Best British Single at the 1988 Brit Awards. <br>

        The video resurged in popularity in 2007 due to the bait-and-switch "Rickroll" Internet meme. In 2008, Astley won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Act Ever with the song, as a result of a collective campaign by thousands of people on the Internet.[8] In 2019, Astley recorded and released a new "Pianoforte" arrangement of the song for his album The Best of Me.[9] In 2023, Billboard magazine ranked "Never Gonna Give You Up" among the 500 best pop songs of all time. <br>
